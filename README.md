# Marketplace-For-Students-Web-Application
 
Complex web application done with several colleagues from the Univeristy as a Project for the Collective Project subject.

It works as a Marketplace, so users can add items they want to sell and other users can see them and message the owner of the ad. It also has a login system that works with Microsoft Teams as the provider, so the users could log into the application with their univeristy's mail accounts.

Technologies used: Typescript, Angular, NestJs.
